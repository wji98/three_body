Fun little project inspired by reading the Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. Code simulates and plots motion of various celestial bodies given initial conditions. Validated with values for the earth and the sun which produces a stable orbit. You can add a third body to see the chaotic motion it would produce, a central premise of the book.
